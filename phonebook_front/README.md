I worked on a phonebook app in parts 2 & 3 of fullstack open using react and node.js. In part 11 which covers CI/CD, I combined the frontend and backend in the same repository and created a deployment pipeline using github actions, docker, and fly.io. The result is a very basic barebones app, you can find it at phonebook123.fly.dev
